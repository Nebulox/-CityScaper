  "description" : "Hello again my not-so-loyal subscribers! I present, the CITYSCAPER!\n\nSupport me on [url=https://www.patreon.com/Nebulox]Patreon[/url] if you like my content, it allows me to make mods more often, and get more creative! Since I have a job and university taking up most my time, all my modding efforts go to commissions, as I can't afford to waste my time, which I really hate. You can personally commission me via discord dms.\n\n[h1]PLEASE NOTE:[/h1]\nThis mod is NOT clientside, if you wish to play with this content with a friend or on a server, both you and your friend or server must also be subscribed to this mod.\nIt IS compatible with FU and Elithian Races Mod and every other damn mod out there... stop asking.\n\n[h1]To build, or not to build!:[/h1]\nA blueprint, accessible via the Planner interface.\nYou can access this interface via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088459034]Quickbar[/url] or with a Planning Bench. crafted at the inventors table, and it looks like an inventors table but rotated and with some metal attachments.\n\nThe blueprint can be used to place a dungeon with left click, any amount of times, and can reopen the Planner interface with right click.\nWhile held, the blueprint will preview the dungeon at the cursor.\n\nThe planner interface has modules, and 3 different tabs; Rooms, Prefabs and Dungeons.\nRooms are single room-style well rooms. These are intended to be placed next to and on eachother to build housing.\nPrefabs are fully built houses, and small dungeons.\nDungeons are things like the Avian Airship, massive dungeons and are generally very expensive to build.\n\nModules represent the mod the content is from, patches should add their own.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2958989874/3824160148616468295/]Here is a guide to making new modules![/url]\n\n[h1]Plans and Notes:[/h1]\n- Various other mod developers will release addons through the module feature.\n- Planned addons so far are Arcana, Saturnians, Knightfall and Shellguard, though these are not 100% confirmed.\n- More content will added with time, this is just the earliest version and is very bare bones in its current state.\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace]Neb[/url]: The placement system, the interface, the graphics and general designs. Implemented the dungeons and also prepared a patch template.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077652646]Monica[/url]: Creating some rooms and prefabs for the main release, and was stinky.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaLovingLad/]Tea-Loving Lad[/url]: Drew the blueprint sprite for the item, and drew the thumbnail on short notice, literal mad [i]tea-loving[/i] lad.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199098507120]Pikachu[/url]: For commissioning this mod and being incredibly patient waiting for my studies and work and letting me work at my own pace. Thanks!\n\n[h1]Look into my empty eyes...[/h1]\nI also have a guide for modding starbound, useful for beginners and veterans! Check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574693146]here![/url]\n\nA teaser of my upcoming mods - you can learn more in the [url=https://discord.gg/uzFUnT5uDQ]Starforge discord server[/url]:\n- TurretGuns\nA new weapon type thatl can be deployed as a turret for a tactical advantage!\n- Revisualiser\nA weapon and maybe armour skin mod, haven't had time to work on this one unfortunately, but its almost ready!\n- Animated Armours\nThis will be the framework and system so other mods can use it, including vanilla compatible mods. To add, vanilla armours will get animated with some life added to them!\n- The Geneforged - A Mewtwo Race Mod\nA Mewtwo race, yeah yeah, a whole damn Mewtwo race, will come with its own energy bar system called \"Psionics\" or \"Psi\" used for Geneforged weapons, techs and gear. There will be a custom progression system involving crafting tms and armour centralised around psi, there will also be custom ships, dungeons, maybe an outpost and much more!\n\nIf you wish to see ANY of the content I make, before it gets released join these servers, in order of how active I am:\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/uzFUnT5uDQ]Starforge server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/Starbound]Starbound server[/url] \nMy [url=https://discord.gg/t/mkWruEK]Discord Server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/t2rWTfJ]Eltihian Alliance server[/url]\n\nI am open to commissions, just DM or @ me on any of the discord servers!\n\nI don't play this game with people, please, please, please, please, please, please stop spamming me.\nDon't add me on steam, just message me on discord, my friends list is way too cluttered as it stands right now.",
